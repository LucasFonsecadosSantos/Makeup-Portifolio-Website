## About this project
A simple and static front end web page developed without framework structure (except bootstrap grid system) with a base structure boot sctipt written by Lucas Fonseca dos Santos.

You will need to install all system requirements to edit and change any parts of this project. The following are listed all requirements.

## How to use
In first step, enter the directory:
```
$ cd Makeup-Portifolio-Website/

Continuing then, to edit the page structures style,
you need to access the SASS directory:

```

If you want to change any html structures, then you need
to access the PUG directory:
```
$ cd src/ext/pug
```

After that, you will need to compiler the changes to output
the .html and .css files, automatically. To do this, you can:
```
$ cd Makeup-Portifolio-Website/
$ ./compile_sass.sh
or
$ ./compile_pug.sh
```

## Execute the SASS and PUG compiler
In project directory

```
<project_path>/project_name
```

execute the following bash scripts:

```
$ ./compile_sass.sh
```

and to execute the PUG compiler, you have to open another bash or terminal emulador and you need to execute the other bash script:

```
$ ./compile_pug.sh
```
